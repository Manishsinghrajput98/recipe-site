						<h4>INDIAN    IDLI-SAMBAR   RECIPES</h4>														  						
						<p>


HOW TO MAKE RECIPE
To make Idli, four parts uncooked rice (Idli rice or parboiled rice) to one part whole white lentil (urad dal, Vigna mungo) are soaked separately for at least four hours to six hours or overnight. Optionally spices such as fenugreek seeds can be added at the time of soaking for additional flavor. Once done soaking, the lentils are ground to a fine paste and the rice is separately coarsely ground, then they are combined. Next, the mixture is left to ferment overnight during which its volume will more than double. After fermentation some of the batter may be kept as a starter culture for the next batch. The finished idli batter is put into greased moulds of an idli tray or "tree" for steaming. The perforated molds allow the idlis to be cooked evenly. The tree holds the trays above the level of boiling water in a pot, and the pot is covered until the idlis are done (about 10–25 minutes, depending on size). A more traditional method is to use leaves instead of moldsthe batter briskly for 4 minutes. this adds volume to the batter and makes it even and smooth.
 reduce the soaking time considerably. Store-bought ground rice or cream of rice may also be used.[12] Similarly, semolina or cream of wheat may be used for preparing rava idli (wheat idli).[13] Yogurt may be added to provide the sour flavor for unfermented batters. Prepackaged mixes allow for almost instant idlis.[14]

In addition to or instead of fenugreek other spices may be used such as mustard seeds, chili peppers, cumin, coriander, ginger, etc.[15] Sugar may be added to make them sweet instead of savory. Idli may also be stuffed with a filling of potato, beans, carrot and masala.[16] Leftover idlis can be cut-up or crushed and sautéed for a dish called idli upma.[17] You can even prepare dahi idli by combining curd and idli together</p>

                            <p class="at-in">   the masoor or toor daal, and the tadka. Like many Indian dishes, sambar is a combination of a grain like masoor or toor daal and a tadka, which is the Indian word for “tempering”.
Tadka, or tempering, is done by heating whole or ground spices in hot oil or glee and adding it to a dish. It is a widely used method in Indian cuisine for many dishes, including sambar.[2]
In sambar, the tadka is traditionally made with several spices, including mustard seeds, sambar powder, asafoetida (also called “hing”) a key ingredient in Indian vegetarian cooking that helps you to digest[3], Indian chili powder, and curry leaves. However, you can add other spices like cumin, turmeric, and fenugreek seeds[4]
                            The nice thing about sambar is you can make it as light or as hearty as you’d like based on the amount of water you add, as well as the types of fresh vegetables you include in the dish. Some possible vegetables for sambar include:
Onion: a required vegetable that will serve as part of the base for the sambar.
Tomato: this will help to balance out the sourness of the tamarind paste.
Spinach: a nice, light dash of green in the stew.
Potatoes: heartier but a great addition to the stew.
Carrots
Drum sticks: a long, green vegetable that resembles a bean, popular in Indian dishes. The soft, jelly interior of the drum sick is eaten and the skin is discarded.[5]
Pumpkin, or white pumpkin.
Brinjal, also known as eggplant.
Okra, also known as “lady fingers”, a highly nutritious pod like vegetable</p>
