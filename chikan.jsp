						<h4>INDIAN   BUTTER CHICKEN   RECIPES</h4>														  						
						<p>


HOW TO MAKE RECIPE
In a medium bowl, place the chicken pieces and sprinkle with lemon juice, olive oil, and 2 teaspoons curry powder. Toss to coat the chicken and set aside.

In a heavy skillet, cook onion, garlic, and ginger in 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter over medium heat until fragrant, about 4 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon curry powder, pepper, salt, tomato puree, and 2 tablespoons butter and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring frequently.

Stir the marinated chicken pieces into the sauce in the skillet. Bring back to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 11-15 minutes until the chicken is thoroughly cooked to 165°F as tested with a meat thermometer. Stir in heavy cream or milk and serve Butter Chicken over hot cooked rice (basmati, if you can!).

And season to taste. No recipe can be all things to all people. If you like mild dishes, reduce the curry powder. If you like it spicy, add more curry powder and think about adding jalapeno peppers or habanero peppers and sautéed for a dish called idli upma.[17] You can even prepare dahi idli by combining curd and idli together</p>

                            <p class="at-in">   the masoor or toor daal, and the tadka. Like many Indian dishes, sambar is a combination of a grain like masoor or toor daal and a tadka, which is the Indian word for “tempering”.
Tadka, or tempering, is done by heating whole or ground spices in hot oil or glee and adding it to a dish. It is a widely used method in Indian cuisine for many dishes, including sambar.[2]
In sambar, the tadka is traditionally made with several spices, including mustard seeds, sambar powder, asafoetida (also called “hing”) a key ingredient in Indian vegetarian cooking that helps you to digest[3], Indian chili powder, and curry leaves. However, you can add other spices like cumin, turmeric, and fenugreek seeds[4]
                            The nice thing about sambar is you can make it as light or as hearty as you’d like based on the amount of water you add, as well as the types of fresh vegetables you include in the dish. Some possible vegetables for sambar include:
Onion: a required vegetable that will serve as part of the base for the sambar.
Tomato: this will help to balance out the sourness of the tamarind paste.
Spinach: a nice, light dash of green in the stew.
Potatoes: heartier but a great addition to the stew.
Carrots
Drum sticks: a long, green vegetable that resembles a bean, popular in Indian dishes. The soft, jelly interior of the drum sick is eaten and the skin is discarded.[5]
Pumpkin, or white pumpkin.
Brinjal, also known as eggplant.
Okra, also known as “lady fingers”, a highly nutritious pod like vegetable</p>
